# OpenNote 📙

Hii 😄! And welcome to OpenNote 📙!

This is a project I recently started, after switching to Linux 🧑‍💻 on my school laptop.
My school is using Microsoft products and a lot of our school material is distributed via OneNote.
As Microsoft is (obviously) not providing a OneNote build for Linux, I had to use the very limited web version.
After trying to use normal OneNote by running it in Wine 🍷 or in a VM, it was clear another solution had to come.

And that's how I got into coding an own OneNote implementation. I know Python 🐍 might not be the best choice to create a
desktop application that has to read and write a lot of pure binary data 🖥️ (that's basically what OneNote files are),
but I wanted to do something with Python for a long time now.

Luckily for me, Microsoft made the whole documentation 📄 of One and OneStore files accessible to the public.
